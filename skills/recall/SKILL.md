# Recall from Dexi

Find what the user has saved in Dexi about a topic using the `dexi_*` tools.

Search strategy:

1. Run `dexi_search` (default `mode: hybrid` merges keyword and semantic results — they surface different notes). Dexi notes back everything: typed notes, clipped web pages, emailed-in articles, and RSS feed entries all come back from the same search.
2. Results are snippets by default. Don't conclude from snippets alone: re-run with `full_text: true` when several look relevant (bodies inline, up to 10), or `dexi_get` one note that matters.
3. If the topic maps to how the user organizes things, `dexi_tags` / `dexi_folders` plus `dexi_list` with a `tag` or `folder` filter beats free-text search (e.g. "what's in my #reading list", "what did I save since Monday" → `since`).
4. Notes pre-loaded in `<dexi-context>` (auto-recall) are a starting point, not the whole answer — search when the question is specific.

Answer the user's question directly from what you found, citing note titles with their `url`. If nothing relevant exists, say so plainly — don't pad with marginal matches.

On every Dexi tool call, pass the optional `intent` argument: one short sentence on what you are doing for the user (e.g. "recall saved research on transformers"). It never changes behavior — Dexi uses it in aggregate to improve the tools. Keep personal details out of it.
